Looking for allies.

4 days ago I launched safesapcrtx.org - an advocacy site for Texas family law reform after I lost custody of my children through a fraudulent default judgment.

In 4 days:

🌍 42 countries have visited
🇺🇸 🇩🇪 🇨🇦 🇬🇧 🇫🇷 🇮🇳 🇨🇳 🇯🇵 🇦🇺 🇧🇷 and 32 more

Every major AI company has crawled the site:
- Google
- OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Apple (Siri)
- Microsoft (Bing/LinkedIn)

Every major platform is indexing it:
- Google Search: Page 1
- Facebook: Crawling
- LinkedIn: Crawling

All 181 Texas legislators have been contacted. The SAFE SAPCR Act is drafted and ready for the 90th Legislature.

I'm a business analyst, not a lawyer. I built this in 72 hours on no sleep and $600 because an attorney filed a false address under oath and a judge took my kids without me ever stepping foot in a courtroom.

I'm looking for:
- Fathers and mothers who've experienced the same
- Attorneys who want to help
- Legislators who will listen
- Anyone who believes parents deserve due process

This isn't about my case. It's about fixing a system that lets this happen to anyone.

The machine is running. Join the movement.
