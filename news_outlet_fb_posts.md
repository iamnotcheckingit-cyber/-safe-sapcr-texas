## FOR LOCAL HOUSTON NEWS (KHOU, KPRC, ABC13, Fox 26)

Texas father loses custody of two children through fraudulent default judgment — never stepped foot in a courtroom.

An East Harris County attorney filed a sworn Certificate of Last Known Address using a 2013 apartment address — despite personally serving the father at a different location just 104 days earlier.

The court mailed all notices to a vacant apartment. The father found out 14 months later via text message.

Now he's built safesapcrtx.org — an advocacy site that's reached 42 countries in 4 days — and is pushing for the SAFE SAPCR Act to fix this loophole before the 90th Legislature convenes January 14th.

This isn't just one case. Texas Rule 239a has zero verification requirements. Any parent could be next.

Is this a story worth investigating?

## FOR TEXAS TRIBUNE / TEXAS MONTHLY

A gap in Texas family law allows attorneys to file sworn addresses without verification — enabling default judgments against parents who never receive notice.

One Houston father lost custody of his two children this way. 104 days before the false filing, the same attorney had successfully served him at a different address.

He's now advocating for the SAFE SAPCR Act (Service Accountability and Fraud Elimination) before the 90th Legislature.

In 4 days, his advocacy site has reached 42 countries organically. 181 Texas legislators have been contacted.

This is a systemic issue affecting Texas families. Would the Tribune be interested in investigating service of process failures in SAPCR cases?

## FOR INVESTIGATIVE UNITS (Click2Houston, KHOU Investigates)

INVESTIGATIVE TIP:

How does a parent lose custody of their children without ever appearing in court?

Texas Rule 239a allows attorneys to file sworn Certificates of Last Known Address with zero verification requirements. One Harris County case shows an attorney filing a 2013 address — 104 days after personally serving the father elsewhere.

Default judgment entered. Father found out over a year later.

Public court records tell the whole story. This loophole affects families statewide.

Worth a look?

## FOR NATIONAL OUTLETS (NBC, CBS, CNN Tips)

A Texas father built an advocacy website in 72 hours after discovering he lost custody of his children through a fraudulent default judgment — 14 months after it happened.

The site has now reached 42 countries. Every major AI company (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Apple, Microsoft) has crawled it. He's contacted all 181 Texas legislators.

He's not a lawyer. He's a business analyst who refused to disappear.

The issue: Texas family law has no verification requirement for service addresses. An attorney can swear to any address under oath. Parents lose their children without notice.

The proposed solution: The SAFE SAPCR Act — legislation requiring actual verification before default judgments.

This is David vs. Goliath in the digital age.

## FOR LEGAL/COURT REPORTERS

Question for legal reporters:

What happens when Texas Rule 239a's lack of verification requirements meets bad-faith litigation?

A Harris County SAPCR case shows an attorney filing a Certificate of Last Known Address using a 2013 apartment — 104 days after successfully serving the respondent at a hotel.

Default judgment entered. Respondent discovered it 14 months later.

The timeline is public record. The loophole is systemic.

The 90th Legislature convenes January 14th. A bill is drafted.

## FOR FATHER'S RIGHTS / FAMILY ADVOCACY PAGES

How many fathers have lost their children to paperwork fraud?

Texas Rule 239a requires attorneys to file a "Certificate of Last Known Address" before default judgments — but there's NO verification requirement.

One father was served at a hotel in April 2024. 104 days later, the opposing attorney swore under oath that his "last known address" was an apartment he left in 2013.

He lost custody without ever appearing in court. Found out 14 months later via text message.

He built safesapcrtx.org in 72 hours. It's reached 42 countries in 4 days.

The SAFE SAPCR Act would fix this. The 90th Legislature convenes January 14th.

If this happened to you or someone you know — you're not alone.

## ENGAGEMENT HOOK VERSION

Question: Should attorneys be required to VERIFY addresses before courts take children away?

Current Texas law: No verification required.

One father lost custody because an attorney swore he lived at an apartment he left in 2013 — after serving him elsewhere 104 days earlier.

The SAFE SAPCR Act would fix this.

90th Legislature convenes January 14th.
