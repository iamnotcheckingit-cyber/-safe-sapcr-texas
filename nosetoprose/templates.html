5.  Petitioner was prevented from presenting this defense by
    the fraud, accident, or wrongful act of the opposing party.

6.  Specifically, Petitioner was not properly served because:
    [ ] The citation was served at the wrong address
    [ ] The Certificate of Last Known Address was false
    [ ] Service by publication was improper because personal
        service was possible
    [ ] Other: ________________________________________________

7.  [Describe the specific facts showing improper service]
    ___________________________________________________________
    ___________________________________________________________

    C. NO FAULT OR NEGLIGENCE

8.  The failure to appear was not due to Petitioner's own fault
    or negligence. Petitioner did not receive actual notice of
    the lawsuit and had no reason to know the suit was pending.

                              III.
                       REQUEST FOR RELIEF

9.  Petitioner requests that the Court:
    a. Set aside the default judgment;
    b. Allow Petitioner to file an answer;
    c. Set this matter for trial on the merits; and
    d. Grant such other relief as is just.

                              IV.
                           PRAYER

    WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Petitioner prays that:

    1. The Court grant this Petition for Bill of Review;
    2. The default judgment be set aside;
    3. Petitioner be allowed to answer and defend; and
    4. The Court grant such other relief as is just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

                <h4 style="color: #0066cc;">Important: A Bill of Review is a NEW Case</h4>
                <p style="color: #0056b3;">When you file a Bill of Review, you are initiating a <strong>completely new lawsuit</strong>. The court will assign it a <strong>new cause number</strong>. Do NOT use the original SAPCR case number on your Bill of Review petition—that case is closed. Your Bill of Review is an independent equitable action to attack the prior judgment. The clerk will assign a new cause number when you file.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="template-grid">
                <div class="template-card">
                    <h3>New Case, New Number</h3>
                    <p>Your Bill of Review petition starts fresh. While you'll reference the original case number <em>in the body</em> of your petition (to identify what judgment you're attacking), the Bill of Review itself gets its own distinct cause number. Think of it as "Case B" suing to undo "Case A."</p>

            <p class="section-intro">Courts require admissible evidence to support your claims. Here's what you need to know about gathering and presenting evidence.</p>

            <div class="disclaimer-box">
                <h4>Key Principle: Objective Evidence from Independent Sources</h4>
                <p>Courts give the most weight to evidence from <strong>independent, objective sources</strong>—not your own statements or those of friends and family. Evidence that comes from neutral third parties or verifiable records is far more persuasive than "he said/she said" testimony.</p>

            <h2>Authenticating Phone & Text Evidence</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Text messages and phone records can be powerful evidence—but only if properly authenticated for court.</p>

                <p style="color: #856404;">Screenshots alone are often challenged as unreliable—they can be easily edited or fabricated. Courts may reject text message evidence if you cannot prove its authenticity. Proper authentication creates a verifiable chain of evidence.</p>
