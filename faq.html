        "@type": "FAQPage",
        "mainEntity": [
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a SAPCR?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "SAPCR stands for Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship. It is the legal proceeding in Texas used to establish or modify custody, conservatorship, visitation, and child support."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a Bill of Review?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A Bill of Review is an equitable proceeding to set aside a final judgment. In Texas, you must prove: (1) a meritorious defense, (2) that fraud, accident, or wrongful act prevented you from presenting your defense, and (3) that you were not negligent."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is extrinsic fraud and abuse of process?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Extrinsic fraud occurs when a party is prevented from presenting their case through deception, such as being denied proper notice. Abuse of process occurs when legal procedures are misused to achieve an improper purpose, like filing false address certifications to obtain default judgments."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a Certificate of Last Known Address?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Under Texas Rule 239a, before service by publication, an attorney must file a certificate stating the defendant's last known address. Currently, there is no verification requirement, creating potential for abuse."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long do I have to file a Bill of Review?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "In Texas, a Bill of Review generally must be filed within four years of the judgment. However, for extrinsic fraud cases, courts may consider equitable factors. Consult an attorney immediately."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "I never received custody papers in Texas. Can I still fight the judgment?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, you may be able to fight the judgment if you were never properly served. Under Texas law, you have a constitutional right to notice of legal proceedings. If you never received the custody papers, the judgment may be void or voidable. Your primary remedy is a Bill of Review. Act quickly as time limits apply."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "I was served at the wrong address in Texas. What can I do?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "If you were served at an address where you didn't live, this may constitute extrinsic fraud. Get the Return of Service and Certificate of Last Known Address from the court clerk. Gather proof of your actual address at the time. You can file a Bill of Review to challenge a judgment obtained through improper service."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "I didn't know about my custody case until after the judgment. Is this legal?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "No, it violates your constitutional due process rights. The 14th Amendment guarantees you notice and opportunity to be heard. If you didn't know about the case, it likely means service was defective - perhaps by publication while the petitioner knew your address, or a false Certificate of Last Known Address was filed."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I respond to a SAPCR in Texas?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "If properly served with a SAPCR, you typically have until 10 AM on the first Monday after 20 days from service to file an Answer. File an Answer denying or admitting claims, consider filing a Counter-Petition for your own custody requests, and attend all hearings. Missing hearings can result in default judgment against you."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "How to file a SAPCR in Texas?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "To file a SAPCR in Texas: (1) Get the Original Petition form from TexasLawHelp.org, (2) Complete with child and parent info, (3) File with district clerk where child resides, (4) Pay filing fee or request waiver, (5) Serve the other parent via constable or process server."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "Who can file a SAPCR in Texas?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Under Texas Family Code: parents, persons with court-ordered possession, grandparents meeting specific conditions, guardians, and CPS can file. Court jurisdiction requires child resided in county for 6 months."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a SAPCR petition?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A SAPCR petition initiates a custody case in Texas, asking the court to establish or modify conservatorship, visitation, and child support. Must be filed in district court and properly served."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a SAPCR order?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A SAPCR order is the courts final judgment establishing custody, visitation, child support, and parental rights. It determines managing vs possessory conservator and is enforceable by contempt."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What SAPCR forms are needed in Texas?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Key forms: Original Petition, Citation, Answer, Counter-Petition, Parenting Plan, and Final Order. Free forms at TexasLawHelp.org and county law libraries."}}
