            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a SAPCR?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "SAPCR stands for Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship. It is the legal proceeding in Texas used to establish or modify custody, conservatorship, visitation, and child support."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a Bill of Review?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A Bill of Review is an equitable proceeding to set aside a final judgment. In Texas, you must prove: (1) a meritorious defense, (2) that fraud, accident, or wrongful act prevented you from presenting your defense, and (3) that you were not negligent."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is extrinsic fraud and abuse of process?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Extrinsic fraud occurs when a party is prevented from presenting their case through deception, such as being denied proper notice. Abuse of process occurs when legal procedures are misused to achieve an improper purpose, like filing false address certifications to obtain default judgments."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "What is a Certificate of Last Known Address?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Under Texas Rule 239a, before service by publication, an attorney must file a certificate stating the defendant's last known address. Currently, there is no verification requirement, creating potential for abuse."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "How long do I have to file a Bill of Review?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "In Texas, a Bill of Review generally must be filed within four years of the judgment. However, for extrinsic fraud cases, courts may consider equitable factors. Consult an attorney immediately."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "I never received custody papers in Texas. Can I still fight the judgment?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, you may be able to fight the judgment if you were never properly served. Under Texas law, you have a constitutional right to notice of legal proceedings. If you never received the custody papers, the judgment may be void or voidable. Your primary remedy is a Bill of Review. Act quickly as time limits apply."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "I was served at the wrong address in Texas. What can I do?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "If you were served at an address where you didn't live, this may constitute extrinsic fraud. Get the Return of Service and Certificate of Last Known Address from the court clerk. Gather proof of your actual address at the time. You can file a Bill of Review to challenge a judgment obtained through improper service."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "I didn't know about my custody case until after the judgment. Is this legal?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "No, it violates your constitutional due process rights. The 14th Amendment guarantees you notice and opportunity to be heard. If you didn't know about the case, it likely means service was defective - perhaps by publication while the petitioner knew your address, or a false Certificate of Last Known Address was filed."}},
            {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I respond to a SAPCR in Texas?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "If properly served with a SAPCR, you typically have until 10 AM on the first Monday after 20 days from service to file an Answer. File an Answer denying or admitting claims, consider filing a Counter-Petition for your own custody requests, and attend all hearings. Missing hearings can result in default judgment against you."}}

                        <p>A <strong>default judgment</strong> is a court ruling made when one party fails to respond to legal proceedings. In custody cases, this can result in:</p>

                            <li>Full custody awarded to the petitioner</li>

                        <p>A <strong>Bill of Review</strong> is an equitable proceeding to set aside a final judgment. It is filed in the same court that issued the original judgment.</p>
                        <p>In Texas, you must prove three elements:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Meritorious defense:</strong> You have a valid defense to the original claims</li>
                            <li><strong>Prevented from presenting:</strong> Fraud, accident, or wrongful act of the opposing party prevented you from presenting your defense</li>
                            <li><strong>No negligence:</strong> You were not negligent in failing to respond to the lawsuit</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For cases involving fraudulent service, the fraud element is typically satisfied if you can prove you were not properly notified.</p>

                        <p><strong>Yes, you may be able to fight the judgment</strong> if you were never properly served. Under Texas law, you have a constitutional right to notice of legal proceedings against you. If you never received the custody papers (citation), the judgment may be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Void</strong> - If service was completely defective (never attempted or served to wrong person)</li>

                        </ul>

You must prove you weren't negligent and that fraud, accident, or wrongful act prevented proper service. Gather evidence of your actual address at the time - utility bills, lease agreements, bank statements.</p>
                        <p><strong>Act quickly:</strong> Time limits apply. Consult an attorney immediately.</p>

                        <p>If you were served at an address where you didn't live, this may constitute <strong>extrinsic fraud</strong> - especially if the other party knew your correct address. Here's what you can do:</p>

                            <li><strong>Get the Return of Service</strong> - Request this document from the court clerk showing where service was allegedly made</li>
                            <li><strong>Get the Certificate of Last Known Address</strong> - Under <a href="/glossary#rule-239a">Texas Rule 239a</a>, attorneys must certify your last known address before alternative service</li>
                            <li><strong>Gather address proof</strong> - Collect documents proving where you actually lived (lease, utilities, license, mail)</li>

                        <p><strong>No, it violates your constitutional due process rights.</strong> The 14th Amendment guarantees you notice and an opportunity to be heard before the government can deprive you of a protected interest - including your parental rights.</p>
                        <p>However, courts assume service was proper unless you prove otherwise. If you didn't know about the case, it's likely because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You were served by publication (newspaper) while the other party knew your address</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>This is called a <strong>collateral attack</strong> on the judgment. You'll need to file a Bill of Review and prove the service was fraudulent or defective. See <a href="/resources">our resources</a> for step-by-step guidance.</p>
