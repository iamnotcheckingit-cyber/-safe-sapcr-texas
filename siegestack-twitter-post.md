**Thread:**

**1/** The problem: Nonprofits and reform movements pay agencies $50-100K for campaign sites. By the time they launch, the legislative session is over.

**2/** The solution: AI-augmented deployment.

5 days. One person. Full stack:
• Multi-language (4 languages)
• Legislator lookup (181 reps)
• Enterprise security (A-grade)
• Email infrastructure
• SEO that actually works

**3/** Proof of concept: safesapcrtx.org

Live. Indexed. Converting.

Built to fight family court fraud in Texas. Now becoming the template for every grassroots movement that can't afford a $50K agency.

**4/** What @AnthropicAI Claude actually enables:

Not "AI wrote my email"
Not "AI summarized my doc"

Full-stack product development at 1000x speed with a $200/month subscription.

This is the augmented symbiosis everyone talks about but few demonstrate.

**5/** ROI breakdown:

Investment: ~$50 (domains + subscription time)
Output value: $50,000+
ROI: 1,000x

This isn't a flex. It's a proof of concept.

**6/** Now we're productizing it.

SiegeStack tiers:
• Launch: $2,500
• Campaign: $7,500  
• Full deployment: $15,000

Every advocacy org deserves infrastructure. Not just the ones with six-figure budgets.

**7/** Looking for:
• Seed investors who get civic tech
• Nonprofits ready to deploy
• Movements that need infrastructure NOW

DMs open. 

The siege begins.
