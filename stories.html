                <p>I was deployed overseas when my ex filed for sole custody. She knew my APO address—we'd been communicating regularly about our daughter. But her attorney filed a Certificate of Last Known Address listing a house I hadn't lived in for three years.</p>
                <p>By the time I returned stateside, a default judgment had stripped me of all custody rights. I was devastated. My daughter was told I had "abandoned" her.</p>

                <p>With help from a veterans' legal aid organization, I filed a Bill of Review. We obtained email records proving opposing counsel knew my current address. After 14 months of fighting, the default judgment was vacated.</p>

                <p>My ex-husband's attorney served papers to my parents' address—a house I moved out of when I was 18. I was 34 when this happened. They knew where I lived; I was still in the same apartment complex where we'd exchanged our kids for visitation.</p>
                <p>The default judgment modified our custody agreement, giving him primary custody and reducing my time with my children to four days a month.</p>

                <p>I represented myself pro se initially because I couldn't afford an attorney. After connecting with SAFE SAPCR and learning about Bill of Review procedures, I filed one myself. The court found extrinsic fraud and set aside the judgment.</p>
