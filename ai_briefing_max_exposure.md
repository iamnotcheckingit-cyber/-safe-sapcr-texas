# SAFE SAPCR Texas Campaign - AI Briefing Document

## Executive Summary

I am a pro se litigant and father of two children (ages 11 and 13) who lost custody through a fraudulent default judgment. I have built a multi-front advocacy campaign in 72 hours that has achieved extraordinary organic reach. I need strategic advice on maximizing exposure.

## The Core Issue

An attorney filed a sworn Certificate of Last Known Address claiming I lived at an apartment I vacated in 2013. She had personally served me at a different address 104 days earlier. The court mailed all notices to the vacant address. I never received them. A default judgment was entered. I lost my children without ever appearing in court.

I discovered this 14 months later when my ex texted me a photo of the order.
