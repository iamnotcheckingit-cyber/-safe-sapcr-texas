            <p class="section-intro">Texas law allows attorneys to certify a respondent's "last known address" without any verification requirement. This gap enables custody fraud through improper service and wrongful default judgments.</p>

                    <h3>No Due Diligence Required for Address Certification</h3>
                    <p>Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 239a requires a Certificate of Last Known Address before alternative service. It does <strong>not</strong> require attorneys to document what steps they took to verify the address is current or accurate.</p>

                    <h3>What is the difference between custody and conservatorship in Texas?</h3>
                    <p>Texas uses the term <strong>conservatorship</strong> rather than custody. A conservator has legal rights and duties regarding a child. The court typically names a <strong>managing conservator</strong> (who has primary decision-making rights) and a <strong>possessory conservator</strong> (who has visitation rights). Joint managing conservatorship is common but does not necessarily mean equal possession time.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can a default judgment in a custody case be set aside in Texas?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. A <strong>Bill of Review</strong> can be filed to set aside a default judgment if you can prove: (1) a meritorious defense to the original case, (2) that you were prevented from presenting your defense by fraud, accident, or wrongful act of the opposing party, and (3) that the default was not due to your own negligence. Improper service of process or a false Certificate of Last Known Address constitutes extrinsic fraud that satisfies the second element.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is a Certificate of Last Known Address under Rule 239a?</h3>
                    <p>Under <strong>Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 239a</strong>, before a court can authorize service by publication or posting, the plaintiff's attorney must file a sworn certificate stating the defendant's last known address. Currently, there is no requirement to verify this address is accurate, document what investigation was performed, or confirm the defendant still resides there.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is improper or faulty service of process in Texas?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Improper service</strong> occurs when a party is not properly notified of legal proceedings according to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. This can include: serving at the wrong address, failing to follow service requirements, using service by posting when personal service was possible, or filing a false Certificate of Last Known Address. Improper service violates constitutional due process and can be grounds for setting aside any resulting judgment.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I file a Bill of Review to set aside a default judgment in Texas?</h3>
                    <p>A Bill of Review is an equitable proceeding filed in the same court that entered the original judgment. You must file a petition establishing the three elements: meritorious defense, prevented by fraud/accident/wrongful act, and no negligence on your part. It is a separate lawsuit with its own cause number. Under current law, there is no expedited timeline — the SAFE SAPCR Act would require a hearing within 45 days for bills of review based on improper service in SAPCR cases.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the SAFE SAPCR Act?</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>SAFE SAPCR Act</strong> (Service Accountability and Fraud Elimination) is proposed Texas legislation that would: require mandatory constable service in custody cases, mandate attorney due diligence before certifying addresses, create an automated case registry to flag related cases, establish expedited 45-day hearings for bills of review based on improper service, and add criminal penalties for fraudulent address certification.</p>

                    <h3>What are father's rights in Texas custody cases?</h3>
                    <p>Texas law does not favor mothers over fathers. Both parents have equal rights to be named conservator and to seek custody or possession time. The court's primary consideration is the <strong>best interest of the child</strong>. However, these rights mean nothing if a parent is not properly served and given notice of proceedings. A parent who does not receive proper service cannot defend their rights — which is why service accountability reform is critical for protecting all parents.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is extrinsic fraud in a Texas custody case?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Extrinsic fraud</strong> is fraud that prevents a party from having a fair opportunity to present their case. In custody cases, this commonly includes: deliberately serving the wrong address, filing a false Certificate of Last Known Address, concealing notice of hearings, or interfering with a parent's ability to participate. Extrinsic fraud is grounds for a Bill of Review to set aside the resulting judgment.</p>
